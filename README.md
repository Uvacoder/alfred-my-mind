This workflow lets you search through entirety of [my personal wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz), [all the articles](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-articles.html) I wrote, [GitHub repositories](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github.html) I made as well as [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev) I share and a lot more.

You can read why I made the workflow [here](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/opening-up-my-mind-%EF%B8%8F-575c8ece8a24).

As this workflow is focused and optimized for fast access to all the knowledge and references I have indexed. It is advised you read through some parts of [my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) first.

My goals with sharing both this workflow and my [wiki knowledge base](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) is to extend my idea of [knowledge bootstrapping](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/knowledge-bootstrapping-36c97e0dee19#.udmp9eotg) and tapping into a person's expertise in the most transparent way possible.
